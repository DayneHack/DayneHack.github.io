<h3>Rain Notifier</h3>
<a href="https://github.com/DayneHack/rain-notifier">Repo</a>
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://rain-notifier.herokuapp.com/">Website</a>
<p>Web app that allows a user to input any city or region in the world, and they will be told if it will rain in the next 12 hours in that region. Uses AccuWeather api to determine both the location inputted and the weather in the next 12 hours at that location.</p>

<h4>Data-Science Projects</h4>

<h3>Classifier comparison</h3>
<a href="https://github.com/DayneHack/data-science-projects/blob/main/classifier-comparison.ipynb">Repo</a>
<p>Random forest vs decision trees classifier comparison. The two classifers are compared on the same dataset after it has been cleaned and balanced. The dataset was balanced by dropping unnecessary columns, filling in missing values, and mapping categorical features to numerical values. To balance the data I used SMOTE and overbalanced because there was a category with far too few cases and I didn't want to remove the majority of samples. We see evidence of overfittting for both random forest and decision trees as the classifier seems to be more accurate on the training data than the testing data. Random forest seemed to have performed better on predicting the validation set as well as a separate test set by a few percent. </p>


<h3>K-means clustering</h3>
<a href="https://github.com/DayneHack/data-science-projects/tree/main/kmeans%20clustering">Repo</a>
<p>My implementation of kmeans clustering from scratch with a slight improvement. The initial centroid selection is improved upon by randomly selecting the first centroid, and then subsequently picking further centroids based off of distance to previously selected centroids. For example, if a centroid is picked, the next centroid will be randomly selected with a probability based off how far it is from the centroids that have been selected.</p>
